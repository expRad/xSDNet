# xSDNet
This repository provides a pytorch implementation of xSDNet, as presented in the paper ***"Joint image reconstruction and segmentation of real-time cardiac MRI in free-breathing using a model based on disentangled representation learning"***.

The code is based on and derived from [Spyridon Thermos' implementation of the SDNet model](https://github.com/spthermo/SDNet). The Spatial Decomposition Network (SDNet) itself is introduced in this [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841519300684).
To use the model, you need to copy the [layers](https://github.com/spthermo/SDNet/tree/master/layers) folder from Spyridon's repo, as those implementations are imported in *xSDNet.py*.
